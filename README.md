## rn-mastodon

A Mastodon client for iOS and Android built with React Native.

Note: This is an educational exercise for me in order to learn React Native. Use at your own risk.

## Setup

For general system setup, follow the guide on https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Project setup:

```
npm install
```

## Run

This will build the app and launch an iOS simulator by default.

```
npx react-native run-ios
```
